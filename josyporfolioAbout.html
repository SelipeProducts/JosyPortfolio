			<h3 style="text-align:center"> About Me</h3>
			<p>
				Growing up I found myself moving constantly from city to city. This bouncing around led to many difficulties including having problems keeping friends. At a young age this isolation somewhat affected me but support and love from my family helped keep my life a little more stable. Separating my social life allowed me to start focusing and excelling at school from a young age. Late middle school would be when I finally settled in my current home located in Chula Vista to help accommodate my mother’s second job in Tijuana, Mexico. Being 15 minutes from the border this provided the perfect situation to allow my mom to transition between her two jobs. With a more stable environment the introduction of other obstacles followed. 
			</p>
			<P>
				Entering high school balancing my social life and school became a more complicated and as a result my grades dropped. One day a friend had asked me what I planned on doing after high school. I replied with plans to get into a well-known University. At this point I can still remember my friend’s facial reaction and her reply about my grades not currently being good enough to achieve my plans. This was a major mental turn around in my mentality about my grades. Entering sophomore year, I made it my goal to take the most challenging courses my school had to offer. This included advance placement classes (AP) and eventually International Bachelorette (IB). In the end my hard work payed off and I was not only accepted to University California, Los Angeles (UCLA) but was granted the Gates Scholarship. 
			</P>
			<p>
				After IB I always believed I was prepared for college. This ideology was flushed down the toilet after my first year in college. But no matter what issues I dealt with I pulled through. With the accomplishment of completing college, I can’t take all the credit as I have my friends and family who helped me survive 4 years of hell.
